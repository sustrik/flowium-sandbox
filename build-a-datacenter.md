# Make a decision to build a datacenter ~> decide

Be frank with yourself. Do we **really** need a new datacenter?

Anyway, if we do, notify the procurement to order machines and the
construction dept. to start building the damn thing.

# Choose a place ~> place: decide

It should be close to water for cooling. Also, the power should be cheap
in the region.

# Build it ~> build: place

Build the walls first. Then the roof.

# Connect it to the grid ~> grid: build

Plug the cable in.

# Ask for quotes ~> quotes: decide

To order the machines, first ask for quotes from different vendors.

# Select a vendor ~> vendor: quotes

Pick the cheapest one.

# Make sure the machines are delivered in time ~> delivery: vendor

Contact the vendor once in a while to make sure there are no slippages.

# Install the machines ~> install: delivery grid

Machines go to racks. You also have to plug the cables in.
